This OXID module displays a QR code on every (frontend) page of your OXID eShop (when accessed with a desktop computer or a tablet). This makes it easier to test modifications in the smartphone version of the site - regardless if you use the OXID mobile theme or a responsive template.


# Installation

Just copy the whole folder to *modules/*. Then activate the module in the shop backend.
